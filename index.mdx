# Overview
## üëãüèº Introduction
[Canonic](https://www.canonic.com) is a free, open-source, browser based on and for Qt's [QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qmlapplications.html) UI language as well as various other file formats.

It is maintained by [haik√º](https://www.deviantart.com/haikuo) and was originally built as a way to make deploying QML applications easier.

A live web app version of the browser is available to try at [www.canonic.com](https://app.canonic.com), possibly making Canonic **the worlds first browser within a browser** thanks to the power of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).

Alternatively you can clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/canonic/canonic) and build from source to use natively.
